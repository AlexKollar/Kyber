### Description:  
PySec is a library of python security tools for use in the field but also as a point of refference for work out in the field.  
I chose python because it is the main scripting language used by security people the world over. Sounded like a good place to start. 
Right now we have a few basic tools with a "netcat replacement" in the works. I hope to implement new tools over time.  

It should be said that this is all code that can be found in: https://nostarch.com/black-hat-python2E   
I am however throwing my own modifications on it.
